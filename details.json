I mostly just ported that code to RPM.\n\nTip: if you use blue (0x00ff00) for the dark colors and white (0xffffff) for the light colors, you'll get a decent enough effect. Try combining different colors to achieve the result you want!\n\nWarning! If you have downloaded this plugin directly from the engine, there might be missing files. You can download the missing files from GitHub on the provided link or from the RPG Paper Maker Discord server.","name":"Waterfall","version":"1.0.1","website":"https://github.com/yaleksander/RPM-Plugin-Waterfall"}
